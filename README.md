## Network Structure and Cooperation

A wide range of policy problems, ranging in scope from reducing carbon consumption to organizing a neighborhood watch, are cooperation problems in the sense that they rely on individuals to engage with others in activity that may not confer benefits net costs. Finding cost effective ways to encourage cooperative behavior within a population could make a significant contribution to the public good. One of the most exciting potential new sources of insight into cooperation comes from examining the mathematical structure of an individual's social network. The topic of this dissertation is suggesting ways to improve the theoretical and empirical understanding of the link between network structure and cooperation, and how these insights can be leveraged in the real world. 

This dissertation will be submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, Princeton University.
